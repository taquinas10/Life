We will create boulncing balls with mass proportional to a random size that have prefectly elastic collisions 
and where collisions between a male and female ball has a chance of resulting in a pregnancy(after adolescence). 
The balls die after a set time and have a speed which is lower during pregnancy. Balls resulting from
a pregnancy inherit some characteristics of both parents. Initially the pregnancies were virus transmissions and
hence the rather politically incorrect "angry" images for pregnancies. 
Future thoughts: predator balls, partial seperation of areas to make populations heterogeneous.
Current settings gives a stable population between 100-150.


NOTE "IMAGEPATH" TO WHERE YOU HAVE PLACED THE Flushed_Face_Emoji.png and angrySmiley1.png IMAGES OF THE BALLS.
I used these images for my program:

and 
https://imgbin.com/png/pZ9Gp7nb/emoji-emoticon-anger-smiley-face-png
but feel free to use whatever images you want.
